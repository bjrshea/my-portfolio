      <p>In 2014, I graduated from the University of South Florida with a Bachelor's in Marketing. In my capstone classes, I focused mostly on data analytics and putting together marketing plans for mock products or ideas. I was sure this would be my focus when I graduated school, but as fate would have it, I ended up moving to Portland and found myself in the tech industry.</p>

      <p>I started working for Simple Finance Technology Corps. in July of 2015 and was hooked to the culture and vision. Being part of a tech company that was trying to "change banking" was exciting, challenging, but most of all, fun.</P>

      <p> That said, as a Production Lead in Customer Relations, I wasn't really creating the product that we were using. Sure, I was part of the overall product, but I wanted to build the software. So, in July of 2018, I made the hard choice of leaving Simple and pursuing a career in Frontend Web Development. Currently, I'm a student at Epicodus (a coding vocational school in Portland, OR), and in about 6 months, I will hopefully be fulfilling that dream of creating that makes people's lives better.</p>
