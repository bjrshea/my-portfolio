        <h3>Thanks for stopping by to take a look at my portfolio! <em>Here's some background about me:</em></h3>

        <img src="img/portfolio-photo.jpg" alt="picture of brendan" border="2">

        <p>In 2014, I graduated from the University of South Florida with a Bachelor's in Marketing. In my capstone classes, I focused mostly on data analytics and putting together marketing plans for mock products or ideas. I was sure this would be my focus when I graduated school, but as fate would have it, I ended up moving to Portland and found myself in the tech industry.</p>

        <p>I started working for Simple Finance Technology Corps. in July of 2015 and was hooked to the culture and vision. Being part of a tech company that was trying to "change banking" was exciting, challenging, but most of all, fun.</P>

        <p> That said, as a Production Lead in Customer Relations, I wasn't really creating the product that we were using. Sure, I was part of the overall product, but I wanted to build the software. So, in July of 2018, I made the hard choice of leaving Simple and pursuing a career in Frontend Web Development. Currently, I'm a student at Epicodus (a coding vocational school in Portland, OR), and in about 6 months, I
        will hopefully be fulfilling that dream of creating that makes people's lives better.</p>

      <h3>Here are a few of the projects I've completed and the languages/frameworks used:</h3>

      <h4><a href="https://github.com/bjrshea/my-first-webpage">My First Webpage</a></h4>
        <p>This was the first project I created at Epicodus. It was a basic webpage that used some basic HTML functionality.</p>

      <h4><a href="https://github.com/bjrshea/wizard-page">Wizards R Us</a></h4>
        <p>This website was all about wizards and why they are amazing. Again, just some basic HTML was used here.</p>

      <h4><a href="https://github.com/bjrshea/vacation-website">The Lofts at SoDoSoPa</a></h4>
        <p>This is where stuff started getting real! We created a website using <strong>both</strong> HTML and CSS. My partner and I created a website for <em>The Lofts at SoDoSoPa</em> , and I think it turned out pretty awesome.</p>

      <h4><a href="https://github.com/bjrshea/Cupcake-Shop">Sweetcakes Cupcake Shop</a></h4>
        <p><em>Sweetcakes Cupcake Shop</em> has all the tasty treats you can imagine. The website we made for it used HTML and CSS, and I was definitely ready for a cupcake by the end.</p>

      <h4><a href="https://github.com/bjrshea/animal-shelter">Portland Animal Shelter</a></h4>
        <p>We felt like Portland needed to revamp their website for all their furry friends, so we used some HTML and CSS as well to build them a new site.</p>

      <h4><a href="https://github.com/bjrshea/Maldives">A Vacation to the Maldives</a></h4>
        <p>Things got real-er when my partner and I made our <em>Vacation to the Maldives</em> website. We used HTML, CSS, <strong>and</strong> the Bootstrap framework to build this site.</p>
